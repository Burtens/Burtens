Welcome to my Git Hub Profile, I am a third year student Studying towards a Batchor of Engineering with Honors, Majoring In Software Engineering at University Of Canterbury, New Zealand. 

## About Me

I am Reliable, personable and astute with proven time management and collaboration skills developed from academic, sporting, theatre, work and volunteer activities. Strong interpersonal skills enhanced by taking part in theatrical activities. Proven academic competency.

I am interested in a role that involves developing and testing of new software with an ultimate goal to make it easier for people to understand and work with technology and would eventually like to progress towards being a project manager.
